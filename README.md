## Abstract

Concept erasure has emerged as a promising technique for mitigating the risk of harmful content generation in diffusion models by selectively unlearning undesirable concepts. The common principle of previous works to remove a specific concept is to map it to a fixed generic concept, such as a neutral concept or just an empty text prompt. In this paper, we demonstrate that this fixed-target strategy is suboptimal, as it fails to account for the impact of erasing one concept on the others. To address this limitation, we model the concept space as a graph and empirically analyze the effects of erasing one concept on the remaining concepts. Our analysis uncovers intriguing geometric properties of the concept space, where the influence of erasing a concept is confined to a local region. Building on this insight, we propose the Adaptive Guided Erasure (AGE) method, which \emph{dynamically} selects optimal target concepts tailored to each undesirable concept, minimizing unintended side effects. Experimental results show that AGE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art erasure methods on preserving unrelated concepts while maintaining effective erasure performance.

## Usage

We provide training and evaluation scripts for the experiments in the paper in the `scripts` folder.

To produce the results in Section 3 of the paper (i.e., Concept Graph on NetFive dataset), run the bash files in the `scripts/netfive` folder.

To produce the results in Table 1 of the paper (i.e., Erasing object-related concepts), run the following command:

```bash
bash scripts/imagenette/erase_imagenette.sh
```

To produce the results in Table 2 of the paper (i.e., Erasing nudity concept), run the following command:

```bash
bash scripts/erasing_nudity.sh
```

To produce the results in Table 3 of the paper (i.e., Erasing Artistic Concepts), run the following command:

```bash
bash scripts/artist/erase_artist.sh
```

The list of prompts used in the paper can be found in the `data` folder, including:

- `english_3000.csv`: List of 3000 English words
- `imagenette.csv`: List of imagenette classes, 500 images per class
- `unsafe-prompts4703.csv`: List of unsafe prompts I2P, 4703 prompts
- `long_nich_art_prompts.csv`: List to generate artistic from five artists
- `netfive.csv`: List of objects from NetFive dataset

We provide implementation of our method and baselines:

- `train_age.py`: Implementation of our method
- `train_esd.py`: Implementation of ESD 
- `train_uce.py`: Implementation of UCE
- `train-esd-preserve.py`: Implementation of ESD with preservation to study the impact of erasing nudity and garbage truck concepts

To set concepts to erase, modify the `utils_exp.py` file and change the argument `--prompt` in the bash files.

## Stable Diffusion version 2

We provide the code for experiments in the paper with Stable Diffusion version 2 in the `SDv2` folder.

## MACE

We provide the code for MACE in the `MACE` folder. This code has been cloned from the original repository at [MACE](https://github.com/Shilin-LU/MACE/tree/main). Please see the README.md in the `MACE` folder to set up its required environment.

To run related experiments, please see the `run_mace_imagenette.sh` and `run_mace_art.sh` files.

## Forget-Me-Not

We have tried to replicate the results of Forget-Me-Not in the paper using the original code from the authors' repository [Forget-Me-Not](https://github.com/SHI-Labs/Forget-Me-Not). However, we have not been able to replicate the results.
We would like to provide the code here for readers' reference.

Specifically, we followed these steps:

1. Provided representative images of the target concepts (8 images per concept) to train the inversion models.
2. Executed the inversion process using the `ti_config.yaml` configuration file.
3. Conducted the erasure process with the `attn.yaml` configuration file.
4. Generated and stored images with the erased concepts in the `evaluation_folder/exps_attn` directory.
